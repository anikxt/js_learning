let a = undefined; // means we don't have a defined value for 'a' yet

console.log(a);
console.log(typeof a);

let b = null; // null means it doesn't have a value

console.log(b);
console.log(typeof b); // think about null as own type null and ignore type object coz it's not at all important

let x;

console.log(x);

// undefined essentially means you have something but you have not given it a defined value

let y = null;

console.log(y);

// null means you specifically set the value of null to 'y' means you given this 'y' a value but this value is nothing
// means 'y' has no value but I specifically have told it that it has no value
// which is why it's null now instead of undefined
